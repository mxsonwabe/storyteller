# EVALS (optional, if you used AI for captions)

Describe how you evaluated caption quality (e.g., check for minute, player, and score presence). Include 2–3 before/after examples.
Before incorporating AI on the captions the generated stories are found in: story_1.json
And after the addition of AI, and example of the generated output is shown in:
story_pack.json
